## Architecture üìê
* Project is in Clean architecture guidelines by Uncle Bob eho came up with the Clean Architecture concept in the year 2012.
* Clean architecture is also referred to as Onion architecture as it has different layers(Presentation, Domain, Data).

* Presentation: A layer that interacts with the view(UI) , in Android like Activities, Fragments, ViewModel.
  Domain: Contains entities and bussiness logic, The business logic put into so called "use case".usecases like fetching data from a network or reading data from database.
  Data: It would implement the interface exposed by domain layer and handle all incoming data (accessing a DB or API).

* Why Clean Architecture?
  Separation of Concerns ‚Äî Separation of code in different modules or sections with specific responsibilities making it easier for maintenance and further modification.
  Loose coupling ‚Äî flexible code anything can be easily be changed without changing the system.
  Easily Testable.
